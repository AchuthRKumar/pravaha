Section Structure:
The "MarketWise Insight" Banner (Top Text/Quote)
Market Overview (Key Indices & Top Movers)
Spotlight Announcements (Curated Latest News)
1. The "MarketWise Insight" Banner
Purpose: A powerful, inviting, and value-defining statement.
Content:
Headline/Quote:
Static (Simple Start): "Navigate the Markets with Precision. Your Edge, Unveiled."
Dynamic (Interesting & Future): "MarketWise: Today's Insight" + (A short, compelling sentence summarizing overall market sentiment or a key theme. e.g., "Positive global cues are driving early gains across IT and Pharma sectors.")
(Advanced: If user is logged in) "Welcome back, [User Name]. Your Watchlist is up +X% today."
Sub-text (Optional): A brief, impactful tagline: "Cutting through the noise, delivering clarity."
Data Source:
Static: Hardcoded in frontend.
Dynamic: Requires a new backend endpoint (e.g., /api/market-insight-summary) that uses LLM to analyze aggregated news sentiment or broader market data (future feature).
Design Notes: Prominent, center-aligned text. Uses your selected font-thin for elegance. Could have a subtle background gradient or animation (if using react-three/fiber effectively for the background).
2. Market Overview
Purpose: Provide an immediate glance at the broader market's performance.
Content:
Major Indices (Nifty 50, Sensex):
Index Name (e.g., "Nifty 50", "SENSEX")
Current Value
Absolute Change (e.g., "+120.50")
Percentage Change (e.g., "+0.65%")
Visual Trend (Suggestion for Interest): A small sparkline chart showing intraday movement, or last 1-day/5-day trend.
Top 3 Gainers / Top 3 Losers (Suggestion for Interest):
Company Name (Symbol)
Last Price
Percentage Change (e.g., "+4.5%")
Actionable Link: Clickable to view company-specific announcements/details.
Market Breadth (Suggestion for Interest):
Number of advancing stocks vs. declining stocks (e.g., "1200 Advancing / 700 Declining"). This adds depth.
Data Source:
Requires a new backend service: nseMarketDataService.js (similar to nseLiveQuoteService.js, but for index/market snapshot data).
New backend API endpoint: /api/market-overview.
Frontend fetches this data once on load.
Design Notes: Clean, tabular or card-based layout. Green for gains, red for losses. Emphasize numbers. Visually separated from the banner and announcements below. Could have a small loading spinner while fetching.
3. Spotlight Announcements
Purpose: Highlight the most recent and/or impactful corporate news from your analysis engine.
Content:
Curated List: The top 3-5 most recently processed announcements from your Analysis collection.
For each announcement:
Company Name (Symbol)
Time of Announcement
Your AI's Classification (e.g., "Potential Upside", "Neutral", "Potential Downside") with the colored tag.
Your AI's Summary (1-2 sentences).
"Why it Matters" (Suggestion for Interest): A very concise, AI-generated sentence (perhaps from a slightly refined prompt) that explains the immediate market relevance based on the company context.
Example: "TechCorp (TCORP): New product launch expected to boost market share. This is a key growth driver for this mid-cap tech firm."
Example: "AutoDrive (ADRV): Faces recall over safety concerns. Could lead to immediate operational cost increases and reputational damage."
Call to Action: A "View Full Announcement" button/link that takes the user to the detailed view (or directly to the PDF/external link, depending on your UI plan).
Data Source:
Your existing Analysis collection, retrieved via /api/announcements with a limit of 3-5, or a new curated-announcements endpoint if you add more complex filtering logic.
The "Why it Matters" part could be an additional field returned by your AI's analyzeNews function, or a separate lightweight LLM call on the frontend for extreme brevity.
Design Notes: Cards, similar to your existing announcement cards, but perhaps slightly more compact. Prominent classification tags. A clear "See All Announcements" button at the bottom of this section.
Overall Data Flow for Hero Section (Summary):
Frontend App.jsx (useEffect on mount):
Make an axios.get request to /api/market-overview (new backend endpoint).
Make an axios.get request to /api/announcements?limit=5 (existing endpoint).
(Optional/Future) Make an axios.get request to /api/market-insight-summary (new backend LLM-driven endpoint).
Backend (New Services/Routes):
nseMarketDataService.js: Scrapes/fetches from NSE for Nifty/Sensex, Gainers/Losers.
marketOverviewRoutes.js: Exposes /api/market-overview.
(Optional) marketInsightService.js: Uses LLM on aggregated Analysis data or macro news to generate insight summary.
(Optional) marketInsightRoutes.js: Exposes /api/market-insight-summary.
